#   UPGRADE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
#   ---------------------------------------

#   upgrade: Upgrade brew itself, and all installed bottles and casks,
#            then upgrade all python wheels installed with pip2, all
#            globally installed node modules, and finally all atom packages.
#   We wait to run cleanup until the next time upgrade is run, so that in
#      the unfortunate event there is a problem with one of the installs,
#      it is easier to revert back to the previous version.

# the following strategy doesn't work for upgrading global npm libraries, because
# many of the global npm modules that we depend on have peer dependencies that
# are not yet depending on the latest versions of their peers. Upgrading the peer
# dependencies to latest breaks the main module (which was the reason we had the
# peer dependency in the first place)
#  npm outdated -g | tail -n +2 | cut -d ' ' -f1 | xargs -n1 npm install -g;
# By changing bootstrap to install with version specifications (as it now does),
#  then the simple npm upgrade works as expected.
